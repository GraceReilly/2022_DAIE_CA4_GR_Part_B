### A: Introduction

-   The two columns chosen to perform linear regression are age and avg_monthly_hrs_gaming as they have a relationship that can be quantified using linear equation. It can be assumed that as age increases, the avg_monthly_hrs gaming may also increase or decrease.

### B: Histogram of average monthly hours of gaming and average age

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
# read in the data from the Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/iviic/OneDrive/Desktop/CA1/amalgamated_game_survey_250_2022 (1).xlsx")

# select a random sample of 200 records
set.seed(123)
sample <- data[sample(nrow(data), 200), ]

ggplot(data = sample, aes(x = age, fill = "Age")) +
geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
labs(x = "Age", y = "Frequency", title = "Histogram of age")

ggplot(data = sample, aes(x = avg_monthly_hrs_gaming, fill = "Average monthly hours spent gaming")) +
geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
labs(x = "Average monthly hours spent gaming", y = "Frequency", title = "Histogram of average monthly hours spent gaming")
```

### C: Confidence interval of average monthly hours gaming on age

-   The confidence interval for the coefficient suggests that the relationship between the two variables is not highly significant within this sample.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# read in the data from the CSV file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/iviic/OneDrive/Desktop/CA1/amalgamated_game_survey_250_2022 (1).xlsx")

# select a random sample of 200 records
set.seed(123)
sample <- data[sample(nrow(data), 200), ]

# perform linear regression on age and avg_monthly_hrs_gaming
model <- lm(avg_monthly_hrs_gaming ~ age, data = sample)

# calculate the confidence intervals for age and avg_monthly_hrs_gaming
confint(model, level = 0.95)


```

### D: Sharpio-Wilk test

-   It appears that the data is uniform as the data points are spread out evenly across the graph.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(lmtest)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)

# read in the data from the Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/iviic/OneDrive/Desktop/CA1/amalgamated_game_survey_250_2022 (1).xlsx")

# select a random sample of 200 records
sample <- data[sample(nrow(data), 200), ]

# Shapiro-Wilk test for age variable
shapiro.test(sample$age)

# Shapiro-Wilk test for avg_monthly_hrs_gaming variable
shapiro.test(sample$avg_monthly_hrs_gaming)

# create normal probability plot for age variable
qqnorm(sample$age)
qqline(sample$age)

# create normal probability plot for avg_monthly_hrs_gaming variable
qqnorm(sample$avg_monthly_hrs_gaming)
qqline(sample$avg_monthly_hrs_gaming)


```

### 

```{}
```

### E: Pearson correlation coefficient between age and average monthly hours spent gaming

-   A Pearson correlation coefficient result of -0.059 indicates a very weak negative relationship between the two variables. This means that as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable decreases.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install and load the necessary packages
install.packages(c("ggplot2"))
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)

# read in the data from the Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/iviic/OneDrive/Desktop/CA1/amalgamated_game_survey_250_2022 (1).xlsx")

# select a random sample of 200 records
set.seed(123)
sample <- data[sample(nrow(data), 200), ]

# calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between age and average monthly hours spent gaming
r <- cor(sample$age, sample$avg_monthly_hrs_gaming)

# create the scatterplot with a regression line
plot <- ggplot(data = sample, aes(x = age, y = avg_monthly_hrs_gaming)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
labs(x = "Age", y = "Average monthly hours spent gaming", title = "Scatterplot of age and average monthly hours spent gaming")

# display the plot and the Pearson correlation coefficient
plot + annotate("text", x = min(sample$age), y = max(sample$avg_monthly_hrs_gaming), hjust = 0, vjust = 1, label = paste("Pearson correlation coefficient:", round(r, 3)))


```

### F: Average Linear Regression of average monthly hours gaming on age

-   The Linear Regression shows that as age increases, there is a negative relationship with average monthly hours spent gaming. As the person gets older there is a reduction in the monthly hours that are played, this is a non-normal residuals linear regression.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load files reading data from excel file and ggplot to create plots
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# reading in the exel data from the excel file located on pc using the read_excel() function and asssigning to the variable data
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/iviic/OneDrive/Desktop/CA1/amalgamated_game_survey_250_2022 (1).xlsx")

# creating a sample dataset containing 200 rows of data from the data variable, using the sample to radomly select 200 rows 
sample <- data[sample(nrow(data), 200), ]

model <- lm(sample$avg_monthly_hrs_gaming ~ sample$age)

# ggplot is used to create a scatter plot x being equal to age and y is equal to avg monthly hours 
ggplot(data = sample, aes(x = age, y = avg_monthly_hrs_gaming)) +
    geom_point(shape=16, size=3) +
    geom_line(aes(y = predict(model))) +
    labs(x = "Age", y = "Average monthly hours gaming", title = "Linear regression of average monthly hours gaming on age") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(20, 50, by = 2)) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 60, by = 5))
